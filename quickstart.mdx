## Understanding Market Mechanics

### How Prediction Markets Work

Prediction markets aggregate collective wisdom by allowing users to trade on event outcomes. Each market has two outcomes:

- **Yes shares**: Represent belief the event will happen
- **No shares**: Represent belief the event won't happen

The price of each share reflects the market's collective probability estimate.

### Example Market

**Question**: "Will the Warriors win the NBA championship?"

- **Yes shares**: Currently trading at $0.65 (65% probability)
- **No shares**: Currently trading at $0.35 (35% probability)

If you believe the Warriors have a 70% chance, you'd buy Yes shares at $0.65, expecting them to rise.
