## Welcome to SportsQuant

SportsQuant is a decentralized prediction market platform built on blockchain technology, inspired by Polymarket. Users can create, trade, and settle prediction markets on real-world events with transparent, trustless execution.

### What are Prediction Markets?

Prediction markets are platforms where users can trade on the outcome of future events. Each market represents a binary question (e.g., "Will Team A win the championship?") with two possible outcomes: Yes or No. The price of each outcome reflects the market's collective prediction of the probability.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized**: Built on blockchain for transparency and trustlessness
- **Real-time Trading**: 24/7 market access with instant settlement
- **Event Coverage**: Sports, politics, entertainment, and more
- **Liquidity Pools**: Automated market making for seamless trading
- **Community Governance**: Users participate in platform decisions
